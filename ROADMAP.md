- [x] Row/col conversion using odd-row offset layout from `lib/hex_coords.go`
- [x] Pixel-perfect click-to-hex coordinate mapping
- [x] Eliminated coordinate drift between frontend and backend

### Professional Mouse Interaction ✅

## 🎯 Phase 5: Readonly Map Viewer (Completed)
**Status**: Production-ready  
**Timeline**: Completed January 2025

### Complete Readonly Map Display System ✅
- [x] PhaserViewer component for readonly map display without editing capabilities
- [x] MapDetailsPage integration with full map loading and statistics
- [x] Proper Phaser.js initialization timing and WebGL context management
- [x] Real-time map statistics calculation and display
- [x] Copy map functionality for creating new maps from existing ones
- [x] Template integration with proper JavaScript bundle loading

### Critical Bug Fixes and Learnings ✅
- [x] **DOM Corruption Prevention**: Fixed dangerous CSS selectors that could replace entire page content
- [x] **Phaser Timing Issues**: Resolved WebGL framebuffer errors with proper initialization sequencing
