## Design Guidelines for Creating New Themed Assets

### 1. Theme Development Process

#### Step 1: Choose Your Theme

Examples of potential themes:
- **Steam Punk**: Victorian-era technology with gears, brass, steam
- **Space/Sci-Fi**: Futuristic technology, energy weapons, spacecraft
- **Modern Military**: Contemporary vehicles and equipment
- **Ancient Civilizations**: Egyptian, Roman, Greek mythology and architecture
- **Cyberpunk**: High-tech, neon, digital aesthetics
- **Post-Apocalyptic**: Scavenged materials, rust, makeshift equipment

#### Step 2: Create Theme Mapping Tables

For each theme, systematically rename every unit and tile to fit the aesthetic:

**Example - Steam Punk Theme:**
- Peasant Militia → Factory Worker
- Knight → Steam Mechanist  
- Dragon Cannon → Steam Artillery
- Castle → Industrial Complex
- Wizard Tower → Steam Engine Tower

#### Step 3: Establish Visual Language
Define consistent design elements for your theme:
- **Color Palette**: 3-5 primary colors that define the theme
- **Materials**: What textures dominate (metal, wood, crystal, etc.)
- **Technology Level**: Medieval, industrial, futuristic, magical
- **Cultural Elements**: Architectural styles, clothing, symbols

### 2. SVG Design Specifications

#### Technical Requirements
- **ViewBox**: `viewBox="0 0 100 100"` for all assets
- **File Format**: Individual SVG files named descriptively
- **Hexagon Template**: `points="50,15 85,32.5 85,67.5 50,85 15,67.5 15,32.5"`

#### Visual Design Principles

##### Rich Textures and Details
```svg
<!-- Example: Metal riveting pattern -->
<circle cx="32" cy="45" r="1.5" fill="#e65100"/>
<circle cx="38" cy="45" r="1.5" fill="#e65100"/>
<!-- Repeat for detailed surface -->

<!-- Example: Wood grain -->
<line x1="22" y1="49" x2="78" y2="49" stroke="#5d4037" stroke-width="0.5"/>
<line x1="22" y1="51" x2="78" y2="51" stroke="#5d4037" stroke-width="0.5"/>
```

##### Gradient Definitions
Always include rich gradients for depth:
```svg
<defs>
  <linearGradient id="metalGrad" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="0%" y2="100%">
    <stop offset="0%" stop-color="#9e9e9e"/>
    <stop offset="50%" stop-color="#616161"/>
    <stop offset="100%" stop-color="#212121"/>
  </linearGradient>
</defs>
```

##### Character Design Standards

- **Terrain Features**: Clear ridges and distinct features indicative of terrain types
- **Facial Features**: Clear eyes, expressions, distinctive features
- **Equipment Details**: Visible tools, weapons, clothing textures
- **Scale Appropriate**: Details visible at small sizes
- **Personality**: Each unit and terrain should have visual character

#### Player Color Compatibility
- **Background Elements**: Use neutral colors that can be tinted
- **Foreground Details**: Use contrasting colors that remain visible
- **Separation**: Ensure important details aren't in areas that will be color-shifted

### 3. Theme-Specific Adaptation Examples

#### Steam Punk Theme Adaptations
```svg
<!-- Replace magical effects with steam/gears -->
<!-- Brass and copper materials -->
<!-- Victorian-era clothing and architecture -->
<!-- Mechanical contraptions instead of magic -->
```

#### Space Theme Adaptations  
```svg
<!-- Energy weapons instead of medieval arms -->
<!-- Sleek metallic surfaces with digital displays -->
<!-- Spacecraft instead of horses/dragons -->
<!-- Futuristic armor with tech details -->
```

#### Modern Military Adaptations
```svg
<!-- Contemporary camouflage patterns -->
<!-- Digital displays and modern equipment -->
<!-- Realistic military vehicles and gear -->
<!-- Modern architectural styles -->
```

### 4. Implementation Workflow

#### Phase 1: Planning
1. **Create mapping tables** for all 32 units and 24 tiles
2. **Define color palette** and material guidelines  
3. **Sketch key visual elements** that define your theme
4. **Choose 3-5 representative units** to prototype first

#### Phase 2: Prototype Development
1. **Create test units** to establish visual style
2. **Validate technical specifications** (viewBox, colors, etc.)
3. **Test player color compatibility** 
4. **Refine design guidelines** based on prototypes

#### Phase 3: Full Production
1. **Systematic creation** following established patterns
2. **Consistent naming conventions** 
3. **Quality control** for visual coherence
4. **Documentation** of design decisions

#### Phase 4: Validation
1. **Visual consistency** across all assets
2. **Functional clarity** at game resolution
3. **Player color testing** with multiple team colors
4. **Performance optimization** if needed

## Prompt for creating new themes


```
Read up Mappings.md first

Ok let us create another Theme - the Modern Military theme with contemporary units similar to the style of the original LilBattle game - do you remember this?  Tell me what your plan for this will be before proceeding

Also make sure you track the progress in a TODO so we can resume on restarts.

Make sure terrains are not flat and have richness in detail.  By richness I mean more than just a few circles and
triangles and capture the essense and character of the tile being generated.

Make sure that all the features are constrained within the hexagonal tile area so it wont be clipped by a neighboring
hex tile.  For river and bridge tiles make sure it covers the entire hex tile - otherwise if it is "flowing" from one
edge to opposite edge a cluster of similar tiles will look disjoint.
