// Presenter service is the P in Model View Presenter
// We noticed that the front end was getting very bloated with not just views but also the 
// cycles of interactions across various components.   So a MVP is being adopted where
// the frontend/views are being as dumb as possible.  They will just react to commands
// and state changes but not be responsible for handling user interactions.  They will just
// present them to the Presenter who will handle the UI logic between the view and the backend (model)
//
// This will also help us mock out the views as we see fit for testing and also have various kinds of views
// eg a Text based views, Typescript views, views over websocket to remote clients etc
//
// The other advantage is we can also change presenters to suit various looks/feels.
// Note that our Presenter service is GameViewPresenter service.  This way we can create one presenter
// per "page" so each page (which is heavy weight and needs wasm) can create one of these.
